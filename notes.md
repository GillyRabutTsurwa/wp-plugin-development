## Summary
- started the creation of a very simple plugin, ironically called simple-example-plugin
  - so far, this plugin does nothing, as there is no code written to initiate functionality
  - however, i have a solid understanding of the plugin folder structure, albeit that ours is very simple
- learnt the differences between regular plugins and must use plugins
- went through some conventions of choosing plugin names
