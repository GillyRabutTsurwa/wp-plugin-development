## Summary
- added a new plugin that serves the purpose of teaching me further on different states of a plugin
- went through some very important hooks
  - [register_activation_hook()][register-activation-hook-link]
  - [register_deactivation_hook()][register-deactivation-hook-link]
- also learnt about the [current_user_can()][current-user-can-function-link]
- we cannot see any results of the code we have written, but it works. i verified it multiple times and i can always come back and test it with commented-out ```wp_die()```.
